Authentication solutions vary based on your requirements and resources. If you need full control over user data, you might consider self-hosted options like [NextAuth (now Auth.js)](https://authjs.dev) or [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com). For those who prefer managed solutions, providers like [Clerk](https://clerk.com) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com) offer hosted alternatives.

Handling sensitive user data, such as passwords, requires strict adherence to security best practices. Refer to the [OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) to ensure secure implementation.
